#type conversion\
# type conversion is the process of converting one data type to another
# in python, we can convert data types using built-in functions like int(), float(), str    
a =int("2") # converting string to integer  also knows as type casting
b = 4.25

sum = a+b # 2.0+ 4.25 = 6.25
print("Sum is: ", sum)
print("Type of a: ", type(a))
print("Type of b: ", type(b))
